# Contributing

When wanting to contribute to any list simply create and issue or a pull request. I will not likely respond to emails in
regard to this project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with any changes that are appropriate, especially in cases where a move of an item from one list to another is warrented and would need to be reflected in the description of that list.
2. Increase the version number in the README.md
3. If this is a crititical change (i.e. someone could get themselves hurt by following any part of this checklist or guide) please create an issue with the pull request.
4. I will do my best to review and merge pull-requests on a first come first server basis.
