# Northwest Hiking Prep

v 0.0.1

## Purpose

This set of checklists is meant as a starting point for new hikers that are ready to start taking on that overnight 5 to
10 mile Trek they've been driving by everyday. You've done the waterfront in town and gone around that wildish area with
the paved paths, joggers, and road noise and you're ready to run out and get a pack and sleep under the stars.

What these checklists are not! I do not mean for these checklists to get you beyond an easy to easy-medium grade trail
at this time. The trails I envision for these checklists and advice are 5 - 7 miles with a 3 to 5 percent grade in well
traveled areas on the edge of your local wilderness park (State/National for us here in the United States). So take
these lists with a grain of sault and do search out other lists and advice to create a well rounded approach to your
first wilderness hike.

My best advice is that in addition to the items on the checklist you also go hiking with an experienced hiker that you
know and trust and/or a friend that is willing to take it easy and one step at a time. Solo hiking is dangerous and
should not be attempted by first time hikers no matter how "easy" the trail ahead may seem, even the most experienced
hikers have gone missing and never came back.

This is not a guide for how to hike or how to camp. It is just what you need to bring with you. Knowing how to set up
your equipment and use your tools is essential preperation before you hit the trail. Always break in your boots!

Now for the checklists!

## Core Essentials

I say core essentials as this is the bare minimum that I would take with me on an overnight hike 2 to 3 nights, in good
weather (75/80 degree high and 50 to 60 degree low, no rain, light wind expected). Often refered to as the
"Ten Essentials Plus", it is an "easy" list of items for the minimum in survival in the outdoors.

Optimally each item on this list should be the lightest available in your price range and total out at a comfortable
weight of no more than 45 to 75 pounds. There is no need to rush out to REI or buy all Patagonia gear for most of the
items on this list, as most can be found at Target, Costco (seasonally), or your local outfitter
([Verle's Sports Center](https://www.verles.com/) if you happen to be in Shelton Washington). Once you have done a few
hikes you'll notice what works for you and what doesn't and that's the time to start replacing different types of gear
with the more pricey, but lighter, and in most cases more durable, proffesional fare. Until then though, just pick up
that Ozark Trail Tent or Target store hiking bag and hit the (appropriate level) trail for you.

## Cold Weather

The Cold Weather checklist is added on if you expect temperatures to drop into the 25 to 35 range at night. Again, this
is not going to be an advanced list for sub zero camping or zooming up the nearest volcano or mountain. My intent is to
bring my hiking into the late fall and still be comfortable.

## Hot Weather

The Hot Weather checklist will not be worked on for quite a while, perhaps 2021. I'm putting it here as a placeholder.
I'll try to get out to Eastern Washington during some hotter weather and create a list for preperation. The items here
are intended for light hiking in 90 to 100 degree heat (I know, some areas around the world are far hotter, so take it 
with a grain of salt here).

## Camping

The point of this list is to add on items that make camping in place at a drive in campground more comfortable. You'll
see items such as camp stove (The big ol green one grandpa brought camping), blow torch, pot, non-stick pan, water
containers, etc. The point of car camping is to get out into the wilderness, turn off, and relax without having to
throw out your back or risk getting lost in the back country. While I prefer hiking off up the trail and pitching a tent
there, I also understand that my family would rather jump out of the car, set up camp, and roast some hotdogs. I enjoy
that time with family, and the relaxation that comes with car camping.
