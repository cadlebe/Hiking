# Essentials to Any Hiking Trip

## Introduction

The idea behind this checklist is to be the bare essentials for going on an easy to medium hike over
the course of 1 to 3 nights in a late spring to early fall setting in a temperate climate (the pacific
northwest in my case). Grabbing this list only should make for a comfortable romp through the trail.

Optimally each item on this list should be the lightest available in your price range and total out
at a comfortable weight of no more than 45 to 75 pounds. There is no need to rush out to REI or buy
all Patagonia gear for most of the items on this list, as most can be found at
Target, Costco (seasonally), or your local outfitter ([Verle's Sports Center](https://www.verles.com/)
if you happen to be Shelton Washington). Once you have done a few hikes you'll notice what works for
you and what doesn't and that's the time to start replacing different types of gear with the more
pricey, but lighter, and in most cases more durable, proffesional fare. Until then though, just pick
up that Ozark Trail Tent or Target store hiking bag and hit the (appropriate level) trail for you.
